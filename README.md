# Fuel-Consumption-Prediction-
This project predicts vehicle fuel consumption (in L/100 km) using machine learning models. The prediction is based on various vehicle characteristics, including engine size, cylinder count, CO2 emissions, and other specifications. The application is deployed via a Flask API for real-time predictions.
